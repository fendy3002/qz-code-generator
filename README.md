# @fendy3002/qz-code-generator

Simple code generator made by nodejs.

# Installation

Use `@fendy3002/qz-exec` to initialize a code-generator project easily, by running:

```
npx @fendy3002/qz-exec@latest create_codegen <project_name>
```

If the `project_name` is not supplied, it'll create one in a folder named `codegen`. If the target folder is not empty, the command will fail.

# Schema

The first is a schema.
